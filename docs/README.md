Graduation Day - August 23rd, 2018

<div style="text-align: justify">
This proud guy holding a master's degree from the Delft University of Technology is me. Re-winding back on how I got here. I was born on a cold Wednesday in the city of Chennai sharply at 4:15 pm. Re-winded too much and cliched like a movie opening scene. Speaking about movies, I love watching movies and binging tv series. I'm not a professional movie critic but not a C-grade audience, Just an amateur blogger who loves to point out and write about films that touched his heart. Oops, I lost track of the 'About' section. Back on track, My hometown is a land of abundant sun named Vellore. It happens to be one of the hottest districts in my state. The temperature in my hometown can go up to 41 degrees during summer. The sun rays can sting your skin to give a heroin shot of vitamin D. Sorry back on track, Concordance with the time of birth, the beautiful hours after school, I liked to sweat in the playground. Instead of concentrating on a single sport, I learned one sport every year. With collars lifted, I can say that I know at least five sports that I can play at an intermediate level. Family pressure, economic status, society, and traditions did not mold me to become a sportsperson but put a book in front of my face. <br /><br />

One good thing about me is that I can develop interests in whatever I do. This trait created a penchant for my studies and helped me to clear competitive exams to get into a prestigious institution to do my bachelor's. My bachelor's degree was in Instrumentation and Control, where I studied diverse technologies ranging from electronics, coding, sensors, control systems, and mathematics. In my initial Bachelor days, I spent mastering FIFA 14 rather than engineering. However, one area that drew my attention back toward engineering was Robotics. Robotics competitions, class projects, and summer internships pulled me back to love Engineering. Since childhood, the Indian education system tested my memory skills more than my practical skills. So, Robotics paved the way to learn Engineering properly and learn the way I wanted. Apart from my studies, I enjoyed playing Handball. Being a part of the college handball team, we won tournaments. I will reminisce about my handball tournaments if I'm closer to someone. During my final year, I got recruited by Tata Motors. I  prepared myself to face the next challenge in my life.<br /><br />

Tata Motors was a platform for me to learn automation and develop my management skills. I worked on automation projects to improve the efficiency of the production line. However, I saw a decline in my learning and the challenges during my tenure. So, my quench to learn more made me look for opportunities. So, I applied and got admission to TU Delft to do my master's in systems and controls. I had to make the tough decision to leave behind my family, friends, and relatives to pursue learning. My curiosity to face the new world, culture, and traditions complimented my decision. The tall buildings and girls amused me when I stepped on the land of cycles for the first time. Often, you won't see girls 6 feet tall and skyscrapers in my hometown. It felt like I was living in 2100 AD, seeing the advancement of the Netherlands.<br /><br />

TU-Delft never failed to surprise me. Apart from engineering fundamentals, TU-Delft tested my time management, organization, planning, integrity, and discipline. It took me a quarter to adapt to the Dutch education system. However, I picked up my pace slowly. I enrolled for the courses that reflected my passion. Besides Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine learning also boarded my passion bus. <br /><br />
